# Port Configuration Analysis

## Current Status
✅ Server correctly running on port 5000
✅ Health check endpoint responding properly
✅ Environment variable PORT properly configured
✅ Host binding set to 0.0.0.0 for external access

## Issues Identified from Port Configuration Image
- Multiple unused port mappings (3000, 3001, 3002, 5001, 6000, 6001, 7000, 8000, 8080, 9000, 9999)
- Only port 5000 is actively used by the application
- External port configuration missing for proper deployment

## Recommendations
1. Keep only port 5000 mapping as it's the active application port
2. Set external port to 80 for standard web traffic
3. Name the port mapping for clarity

## Optimal Configuration
```toml
[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80
name = "main-app"
```

This configuration:
- Maps internal port 5000 to external port 80
- Provides clear naming for the application port
- Removes unnecessary port mappings that could cause confusion
